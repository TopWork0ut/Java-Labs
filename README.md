Create the class:

Use the possibilities of OOP: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.
Each class should have a title that fully describes its essence and informative composition. Attributes and methods of classes should be defined independently
Inheritance should be used only when it makes sense. In the case of inheritance, the number of descendant classes must be at least 2 and not more than 4
When writing a program, you need to use the python code convention.
You do not need to display all set / get pairs for class attributes to avoid chart clogging
To implement search / sort operations, you must implement a separate class (in the name of which the word Manager must be present).
