### Task condition: 

Department of garden tools. 
Implement the hierarchy of garden tools present in the store. Implement the search for tools needed for preventive work with trees in the garden.

------

### To run the program you just need to:

1) Run the terminal and go into the folder which is previous to the package.

2) Run javac which will convert it into class file ( from readable for eyes code to the bytecode ), that will be read by JVM.

package - is an example of caption, it could be nulp/lviv/iot...

```java
javac package/*.java
```

3) Run Main.class which alredy includes bytecode by this command:

```java
java package.Main
```

That's all ;)
